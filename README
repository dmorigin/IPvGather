This python script reads out all sensor data from a GoodWe inverter and put them
into a InfluxDB2 database.

# Dependencies
    - GoodWe
    - Influxdb2

    Install using pip

    pip install goodwe=0.2.20
    pip install influxdb-client=1.36.1

# Run this script

    python ipvgather.py -c [file.json]

# Script Parameters

    -c [file]   Path and filename of the configuration file
    --check     Use this additionally to check the your configuration file
    --discover  With this flag, ipvgather will search for an GoodWe inverter

# Configuration file

    The configuration file is formatted in JSON. An example can be found
    in 'src/config.json'. To use your own configuration file use the '-c'
    option to set a specific configuration file. Otherwise '/etc/ipvgather.json'
    will be used as default.

# Recommendations

    There are different families of the GoodWe inverters. You have to setup the series
    inside the configuration file as 'family'. The following families are valid:

        ET, EH, EM, NS, XS, BP

    If you leave this value empty or set it to 'none' the system try to discover
    the family automatically. It is recommended to set this value to one of the
    valid values.

    Next part is the 'Comm Address'. Defined in comm_addr inside the config file. Use one
    of the following values

        0xf7 -> for ET/EH Family
        0x7f -> for DT/D-NS/XS Family

    If you leave this value empty or set it to 'none' the system try to detect the
    Comm Address automatically. Auto detection works in the most cases. So, set this
    to 'none'.

# First Run

    If you run this script for the first time, please do a discover first. Except you
    know exactly all data of your GoodWe inverter.

    Run: python ipvgather.py --discover

    Example output:

    Identified inverter
    - Model: GW8K-ET
    - SerialNr: 12345ETU226W1234
    - Version: 04029-08-S11
    - IP: 192.168.1.23
    - MAC: AAAABBBBCCCC
    - Name: Solar-WiFi226W1234

    Now, setup your configuration file and start this script normaly.

    Run: python ipvgather.py -c your_config.json

# Logging

    This script log some data. The default log file is '/var/log/ipvgather.log'.
    In some cases this can be lead into a 'permission denied' error, if you run
    this script not as 'root'. It's not recommended to run this script as 'root'.

    If you has some trouble, use the log level for more informations:
